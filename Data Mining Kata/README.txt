Data Mining Kata
================

1. Extracting the minimum temperature variance
----------------------------------------------

Give the file Weather.txt you should work out which month had the minimum variance.

Initially don't worry about file handling, use the data directly.

Hint: Start with a failing acceptance test.

2. Extracting the team with the lowest goal difference
------------------------------------------------------

Give the file football.txt you should work out which team had the lowest absolute goal difference

This should not be the same source code as you had for (1)

3. Combine the two projects
---------------------------

There is a lot of similarity between the two projects, therefore it should be possible to abstract a 
lot of the code into a core and still provide the implementations above. 

Refactor the two projects so that they work together.
