This is my base repository for where I will be able to do katas 

The structure is a folder for each Kata

* Checkout Kata
   * C#
   * F#
   * ... (language)
* Data Mining Kata

Very little code will be maintained in the actual master branch. A branch will be created per attempt that
will describe the date and the Kata being performed
